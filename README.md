# Second Brain

My personal knowledge management system, designed to help me organize, connect, and recount my study notes. Built on a framework of interconnected markdown files, this system not only helps manage and visualize knowledge but also integrates AI (coming soon) to actively quiz me on the content. This ensures I not only capture ideas but also retain and reinforce them over time.
